# DuckNet-Tools
A series of IT and Cyber tools hosted in a local web browser

## History
Whenever I go to conferences or chat with other professionals, I always find tools that I haven't heard of that I want to incorporate into my workflow. The trouble I end up having is that I can never find them when I need them,b ecause they're written down in some throw-away journal or saved in any number of emails or chat messages. Having a central repo that can host all of these is the best way for me to continuously use the tools that are available.

## Strategy
This is designed to live as a series of Docker containers that can be deployed locally. Some tools will need to exist in their own environment, while others are simple links or API calls to online resources.
